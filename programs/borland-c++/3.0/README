 1. HOW TO GET HELP
-------------------
  If you have any problems, please read this file, the
  HELPME!.DOC and other files in your DOC subdirectory, and the
  Borland C++ manuals first. If you still have a question and
  need assistance, help is available from the following sources:

  1. Type GO BPROGB on the CompuServe bulletin board system for
     instant access to the Borland forums with their libraries of
     technical information and answers to common questions.

     If you are not a member of CompuServe, see the enclosed
     special offer, and write for full details on how to receive
     a free IntroPak containing a $15 credit toward your first
     month's on-line charges.

  2. Check with your local software dealer or users' group.

  3. Borland's TECHFAX service. Call (800) 822-4269 for a FAX 
     catalog of entries.

  4. If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait and you have
     sent in the license agreement that came with the package,
     you may call the Borland Technical Support Department at
     (408) 438-5300. Please have the following information ready
     before calling:

     a. Product name and serial number on your original
        distribution disk.  Please have your serial number ready
        or we will be unable to process your call.

     b. Product version number. The version number for Borland
        C++ can be displayed by pressing Alt-H/A.

     c. Computer brand, model, and the brands and model numbers of
        any additional hardware.

     d. Operating system and version number. (The version number
        can be determined by typing VER at the DOS prompt.)

     e. Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

     f. Contents of your CONFIG.SYS file.


 2. INSTALLATION
----------------

  You MUST use the INSTALL program to install Borland C++. The
  files on the distribution disks are all archived and have to be
  properly assembled.  You cannot do this by hand!

  To start the installation, change your current drive to the one
  that has the install program on it and type INSTALL.  You will
  be given instructions in a box at the bottom of the screen for
  each prompt. For example, if you will be installing from drive
  A:, type:

    A:
    INSTALL

  -  This INSTALL handles the installation of both the compiler
     and debugger and tools in one operation, and allows several
     new configuration options.

  -  After installation, make sure you insert \BORLANDC\BIN - or
     whatever you selected as your BIN directory - into
     your DOS path so the DLL and executable files can be found.

  -  Note: The list of files is contained in a separate file
     called FILELIST.DOC, which will appear in the target
     directory you specify during installation.

  -  If you have previously installed Resource Workshop, make sure
     that you remove the directory of that version from your path. The
     version included on these disks supercedes previous versions.

  -  If you use a Windows command shell other than Program Manager,
     you may not get a Borland C++ group installed for Windows. If
     you don't, use File|Run in Program Manager to run the following
     command:

          GROUPS GROUPS.B$$

     You will then have a new group for Borland C++.

  -  If you chose to put Turbo Debugger files in a non-default
     directory which is not on your path, you will need to copy
     WINDEBUG.DLL from that directory to one which is on your path if
     you want to debug Windows applications with Turbo Debugger.

  -  After your initial installation, you can run INSTALL again to
     add elements you omitted the first time. Just select only the
     things you want to add in the INSTALL options screen. Because
     some things you may want to save could be overwritten, review
     the following items to make sure you don't lose important
     information:

     1.  Selecting CMD (the Command-line compiler) causes an 
         overwrite of any existing turboc.cfg & tlink.cfg file
         with path information provided in that INSTALL session.
         Any switches other than -L (library path) and -I
         (include path) will not be preserved.

     2.  Selecting IDE will clear the previous settings for the
         desktop and default project and reset them to the
         defaults (for instance, 25-line display mode), and the
         include and library paths will be reset to the paths
         provided in that INSTALL session.

     3.  By selecting any one of the following, the help file
         paths and choices for THELP.CFG will reflect the current
         session's installation choices: 
         
              a. CMD - command-line compiler 
              b. IDE - integrated environment
              c. TD - Turbo Debugger
              d. TASM - Turbo Assembler 

     4.  Alterations to headers or startup files will be
         overwritten if any library models are selected.

     5.  Selecting the Create BorlandC++ Group option will add an
         icon to the existing group.

     In general, any selection you make of something installed
     earlier will cause an overwrite of the earlier version
     without prompting.


  You should read the rest of this README file to get further
  information about this release before you do the installation.


 3. FEATURES
------------

  Borland C++ 3.0 includes complete support for Windows
  programming, as well as big speed and capacity gains.  Here are
  some important features found in this version:

  - A Windows hosted IDE (TCW.EXE), including a class hierarchy 
    browser.

  - New code optimization features. 

  - Turbo Debugger support for breakpoints with multiple conditions
    and for viewing selectors.

  - Profiling under Windows (TPROFW.EXE).

  - Remote debugging using a Novell-compatible network.

  - DPMI services for increased capacity and operation under Windows
    3.0 Enhanced Mode.

  - C++ 2.1 support, including the new nested class specifications,
    and support of C++ 3.0 templates.

  - Added library functions for compatibility with other runtime 
    libraries, and addition of support for long double parameters
    in math functions. (Please see the Library Reference for details.)

  - New MAKE features. (Please see the Tools and Utilities Guide
    for details.)

  - EasyWin, which includes library support for stdio.h and
    conio.h functions under Windows. (Please see the Borland C++
    User's Guide for details.)

  - Object oriented assembler features in Turbo Assembler.

  - Added BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) fonts and support. (See
    "New BGI fonts", below.)

  - A resident DPMI kernel program, DPMIRES.EXE. (See "DPMI", below.)

  - WinSight, a debugging tool for examining Windows messages
    and general information about Windows classes. (Please see the Tools
    and Utilities Guide for details.)


  - FCONVERT.EXE -  Converts OEM to ANSI Character Set

      DOS text files use the OEM character set; Windows text
      files generally use the ANSI character set. The demo
      program, FCONVERT.EXE converts data back and forth between
      these formats. The only text files that will be affected
      are those containing international characters (ASCII values
      above 128) like the umlaut, etc. Not all OEM characters are
      present in the ANSI character set, and vice versa. 
      Therefore, converting between these character sets may
      produce a mapping that is not reversible.  Refer to your
      Windows documentation for further information about ANSI
      vs. OEM character sets.

  - Inline versions of string and memory library functions for
    code efficiency. (Please see the section on Intrinsic
    Functions in Appendix A in the User's Guide for details.)

  - THELP now allows you to switch between help files without
    unloading and reloading. (Please see UTIL.DOC for details.)


NEW BGI FONTS
-------------

Several new fonts have been added to the Borland Graphics Interface:


Name            Value   Description
-------------------------------------------
SCRIPT_FONT     5       Stroked script font
SIMPLEX_FONT    6       Stroked simplex font
TRIP_SCR_FONT   7       Stroked triplex script font
COMPLEX_FONT    8       Stroked complex font
EURO_FONT       9       Stroked European font
BOLD_FONT       10      Stroked bold font

The fonts in the BGI now support the full ASCII character set.

DPMI
----

BC.EXE, BCC.EXE, and TLINK.EXE are now hosted under DPMI. These files
replace both the files with the same name in Borland C++ 2.0 and the
BCX.EXE, BCCX.EXE, and TLINKX.EXE files in the same product. There is
no longer a TKERNEL.EXE file.

If you encounter a "machine not in database" message while attempting
to run the compiler, run the DPMIINST program to add your machine
configuration to the DPMI server database.

This version includes a resident DPMI host program, DPMIRES.EXE, that
allows you to preload the server before invoking BC, BCC, or any other
DPMI-hosted executables. If you want to run such hosted EXEs in a
Windows Standard Mode DOS window, you should run DPMIRES.EXE before
loading Windows. To do this, enter the following commands at DOS:
 
  set DPMIMEM=MAXMEM 2000
  dpmires
  win /s

If you want to limit the amount of extended memory used by the
DPMI-hosted executables, an environment variable called DPMIMEM
can be set to do so. For instance, the command

  set DPMIMEM=MAXMEM 2000

reserves about 2 Mb of memory for DPMIRES. The number after MAXMEM
can be adjusted, but cannot be lower than 1000.

The hosted executables cannot spawn each other when SHARE is loaded.
For instance, if you run MAKE on a file which in turn calls MAKE
again, you will get a sharing violation. In this specific case,
you can call the real mode version, MAKER, within the given makefile,
and a sharing violation won't occur.


 4. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
-------------------------

  - There is now only one version of the DOS IDE, BC.EXE, and
    of the command-line compiler program, BCC.EXE. Because the
    BCX and BCCX files are no longer in Borland C++,  you'll need
    to alter batch or make files that use those names.

  - Borland C++ only supports Protected Mode Windows target
    files. Make sure to use the /t option when using the Resource
    Compiler if you want to enforce Protected Mode usage.

  - When using Brief with THELP, make sure to use Brief's -p
    switch to ensure that the thelp window will be visible.

  - We recommend that you use the following mouse drivers with
    this product:

       Microsoft Mouse version 7.04 or later;
       Logitech Mouse version 5.01 or later;
       Genius Mouse version 9.06 or later.

  - If you use MAKE or the IDE's Project Make to invoke the Resource
    Compiler, the .RC files you wish to compile MUST be in the same 
    directory as your project or makefile.  This is because the Microsoft
    Resource Compiler does not properly handle relative path names, and
    returns a misleading error message that refers to an incorrectly
    spelled version of your .RC file.


  - If you get a "floating point formats not linked" message at
    runtime, put the following somewhere in your source files:

        extern void _floatconvert();
        #pragma extref _floatconvert

    This will force inclusion of floating point formats, which
    may not be linked to reduce executable size.

  - Make sure that you use the -WE switch (Options|Compiler|Entry|
    Windows <DLL> explicit functions exported in the IDE) when
    using the fastcall modifier. The same applies when using the
    fastcall compilation option (-pr on the command line,
    Options|Compiler|Entry|Register in the IDE.)


  COMPILER

  - The default extension for source files to the command-line
    compiler is .CPP; that is, if you enter

       BCC -c test

    the compiler will search for test.cpp, and give an error if a
    file of that name cannot be found. If you want to have the
    command-line compiler assume a .c extension and C language
    source, use the command-line option -P-c. For more
    information, see "The command-line compiler" in the User's
    Guide.

  - Note that the Generate COMDEFs choice under
    Options|Compiler|Code Generation and the -Fc command-line
    option are only supported in the C language. Linker errors
    will result if you attempt to use a communal variable in C++.

  - The macros min() and max() are not defined when stdlib.h is
    compiled as C++ (to allow their use in 3rd party libraries,
    etc.).

  - Note that SYMDEB creates .SYM files for use in debugging;
    Borland C++ creates .SYM files for pre-compiled headers. They
    are not compatible and collisions should be avoided by
    setting the name of the pre-compiled header file (using -
    H=filename).

  - There is now full support of distance modifiers (near and
    far) used for class member pointers. Here are two sample
    declarations and their meanings:

       void (A::* far var) ();

    this is a far variable 'var' of type 'void (A::*)()';

       void (far A::* var) ();

    this is a 'default distance' variable 'var' of type
	'void (far A::*)()'

  - You must use "smart callbacks" - -WS from the command line,
    Options| Compiler|Entry/Exit Code|Windows smart callbacks in
    the IDE - if your application uses classes whose code is in a
    DLL. This applies especially in the case of a class
    implemented in an EXE which is derived from another
    implemented in a DLL, which normally applies for users of OWL
    and other object-oriented class libraries.

  - If you use C++ templates, and use a separate TLINK command
    line rather than letting BCC invoke TLINK, you should make
    sure that you turn on case-sensitive links with the /c switch.

  IDE

  - When debugging a mouse application the Options|Debugger|Display
    Swapping option should be set to "Always" for best results.

  - In the DOS IDE, the mouse cursor is turned off during compilation
    for performance improvements.

  - If you run File|Printer setup from TCW.EXE (or another Windows
    application which has printer setup support) under the Windows
    3.0 debugging kernel, you will get a System Error from Windows.
    You must switch to the NODEBUG version to run this option.

  - The initial block marking behavior in the IDE is determined
    by which version of the IDE is used first after installation.
    Invoking TCW.EXE first will cause Windows-style block marking
    conventions to be in effect; otherwise the standard DOS IDE
    behavior will be used. You can change the behavior by
    selecting Options|Environment| Editor and changing the
    settings for Persistent blocks and Overwrite blocks.

  WinSight

  - WinSight traces messages received by GetMessage or SendMessage. It
    does not trace messages sent directly by function call such as
    WM_INITDIALOG.

  - Please note that messages displayed as "dispatched" are actually
    intercepted at the time of GetMessage, not DispatchMessage.


  EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

  - When you are running any example programs that come with .PRJ
    files, if you didn't use the standard directories when you
    installed Borland C++ you will have to change the .PRJ file
    to reflect your actual directory setup.  Do this from inside
    Borland C++ with Alt-O/D.


  LINKING C++ WITH C

  - Linking C++ modules with C modules requires the use of a
    linkage specification.  Prototypes for C functions within C++
    modules must be in one of the following forms:

        extern "C" declaration
        extern "C" { declarations }

    For example, if a C module contains these functions:

        char *SCopy(char*, char*);
        void ClearScreen(void)

    they must be declared in a C++ module in one of the
      following ways:

        extern "C" char *SCopy(char*, char*);
        extern "C" void ClearScreen(void);

      or

         extern "C" {
            char *SCopy(char*, char*);
            void ClearScreen(void);
         }

    Failure to do so will result in "Undefined symbol" errors
      during link. For further examples, see the standard header
      files.

  OPTIMIZATIONS

  - When Ignore Aliasing is used - -Oa from the command line, or
    Options|Compiler|Optimization|Assume no pointer aliasing in
    the IDE - some initializations could be skipped. This applies
    only when Copy propagation -Op or Options|Compiler|Optimization|
    Copy propagation is used as well (which is the case when
    using -O2 or Options|Compiler|Optimization|Fastest Code.) The
    following case illustrates the issue:

        len = 0;
        read(help_file, (char *)&len, 1);
        read(help_file, (char *)title, len);

    The initializion of len to the value 0 above will probably
    not be reflected in the first call to read() if aliases are
    ignored. If the initialization of len were guaranteed by the
    call to read(), the first line would be unnecessary, and the
    value in len would be assigned and passed to the second read
    correctly. We recommend that you avoid using these options
    together when explicit initializations are used in code
    sequences like these.


  TURBO DEBUGGER/TURBO PROFILER/TURBO ASSEMBLER

  - Some Windows mouse drivers are incompatible with Turbo
    Debugger, and will cause the mouse cursor to get scrambled
    when debugging DOS graphics applications on a second monitor
    (-do option).  If that happens, you can try a different
    driver, or turn off the mouse in TD by using the -p- option on
    the TD command line.  The mouse will still be active in the
    target application.

  - You cannot set a window message breakpoint by using a window
    handle in an ObjectWindows application. You can, however, set
    window message breakpoints with ObjectWindows applications by
    enabling ObjectWindows support (use TDINST -w and choose
    Options|Source Debugging|OWL Window Messages), then using
    window object names to set message breakpoints.

  - The MEMPAGE segment attribute in TASM is not currently
    supported by TLINK.  This option was added to TASM to support
    a feature of the Phar Lap linker.

  - The first time a program is run under TDW or TPROFW, mouse
    messages are processed normally. However, on every subsequent
    execution of that program,  you must press a key on the
    keyboard before mouse messages can be processed.

  - On page 10 in Chapter 1 of the "Turbo Profiler User's Guide,"
    there is a statement that Pascal versions of the PRIMEn.C
    programs are included  on disk. Only the C versions of these
    sample programs are included on the distribution disks.

  Super VGA support for TDW & TPROFW
  ==================================

  TDW and TPROFW handles most of the popular 2, 4, and 16-color
  high-resolution Super VGA modes. If your card isn't supported
  correctly, or if you want to debug in a 256-color mode, you'll
  need to use a special Super VGA DLL.

  Currently, the following DLLs are supplied with your language
  compiler to support these SVGA cards and modes:

    TSENG.DLL (TSENG ET-3000 /ET-4000 based cards)
       640x480x256
       800x600x256
       1024x768x256


    ATI.DLL (ATI VGA Wonder card)
       640x480x256    (See the NOTE below)
       800x600x256

  To use a Super VGA DLL, copy the appropriate DLL file into the
  directory that contains the TDW or TPROFW executable (usually
  the BIN subdirectory of your language compiler directory), and
  rename it to TDVIDEO.DLL.

  TDW (or TPROFW), upon loading, looks for TDVIDEO.DLL in the
  same directory that harbors TDW.EXE (or TPROFW.EXE). If it
  finds the file, TDW (or TPROFW) accesses the DLL as it's
  needed. TDW (or TPROFW) makes calls to the DLL to handle the
  entire video screen switching context. The DLL accomplishes the
  screen switching by allocating a buffer as it gets loaded.
  Graphic screen contents are then saved to this buffer as TDW
  (or TPROFW) enters text mode. The DLL restores the graphics
  screen from this buffer as TDW (or TPROFW) exits text mode.
  Memory allocated for the buffer is freed when the DLL is
  unloaded.

  If there is an error loading TDVIDEO.DLL, or if the DLL doesn't
  support the selected card or mode, TDW will report the error in
  a Windows dialog box. When this happens, TDW will unload
  TDVIDEO and exit. If this situation occurs, delete TDVIDEO.DLL,
  or select a mode that is supported by the DLL.

  If you're debugging an application that's been built with
  EasyWin, you may see incorrect screen painting as you step over
  lines of code that make calls to STDIO functions. In this case,
  edit the TDVIDEO.INI file and set the Int2FAssist option to
  "yes" (see the NOTE below).

  NOTE: The ATI mode 640x480x256 and EasyWin applications may
    require some special handling. An option called Int2FAssist
    in the TDVIDEO.INI file allows this mode work to correctly on
    most systems. The behaviour is as follows: When you set
    "Int2FAssist=yes", TDVIDEO makes Windows tell all sub-windows
    on the screen to re-paint themselves as the DLL is loaded.
    This allows the user screen to be viewed when Stepping,
    Tracing, or Running your application. It will not, however,
    switch to the user screen when you press <Alt-F5> since TDW
    is still in control (it doesn't allow Windows to process any
    messages). If you also set "SaveWholeScreen=yes", then <Alt-
    F5> will show the user screen (TDVIDEO will now copy the
    screen for you). The drawback to enabling SaveWholeScreen is
    that it will take longer to Step or Trace if TDW needs to
    switch back to the user screen for that particular
    instruction. Also, extra messages are getting passed to your
    application that normally would not be passed. This may
    effect the debugging of certain pieces of code (like finding
    a bug in an owner-draw procedure). In these cases, you should
    avoid this video mode.


  TDVIDEO.INI
  -----------

  You can create the file TDVIDEO.INI with any ASCII text editor.
  This file is used to control how TDVIDEO.DLL functions.
  TDVIDEO.INI must be located in WINDOW's main directory (usually
  C:\WINDOWS). The options in TDVIDEO.INI are handled by the DLL
  itself and are therefore subject to change with newer versions
  of the DLLs. The DLLs use the following options, written in any
  order, under the heading [VideoOptions]:

    SaveWholeScreen --    default = 'no'
    Int2FAssist     --    default = 'no'
    DebugFile       --    default = ''  (no logging will occur)

  The SaveWholeScreen and Int2FAssist can be set to either 'yes'
  or 'no'. DebugFile can be either blank, or it can be set to a
  specific filename.

  *** SaveWholeScreen ***

    This option, normally set to 'no', determines whether the
    entire screen (512k - 64k from 8 planes) will be saved (the
    entire graphics screen is cleared when switching to it) or if
    only the top 32K of planes 0 through 3 will be saved (the
    entire screen is NOT cleared when switching modes.)

    Saving the whole screen is rarely needed, but is provided in
    case you're using a nonstandard card that needs the whole
    screen to be saved.

  *** Int2FAssist ***

    This option, normally set to 'no', tells TDVIDEO, to make a
    special Int 2F call before switching video modes. This call
    tells the current Windows screen driver (VGA.DRV for standard
    VGA mode) what's happening. The desired side-effect of this
    call is to make Windows tell all of its child windows to re-
    paint themselves. This option is provided only for support for an
    ATI Super VGA video mode and for applications built using
    EasyWin (see NOTE above). However, be aware, that this option
    can affect the other supported modes if it's enabled (use
    this option only if absolutly necessary).

  *** DebugFile ***

    TDVIDEO.DLL normally doesn't save any debugging information.
    If you're having problems using a special DLL, the DebugFile
    option can be used to specify the path and filename of a log
    file. Information logged to this file can be used if you need
    to contact Borland's Technical Support. Information logged
    consists of the Date/Time, the version of the DLL, the name
    of the Windows screen driver that is currently in use, the
    state of all .INI options, and a listing of all the calls to
    the DLL's functions.

    For example, if you want your DLL to save the entire screen
    and log information to a file named C:\WINDOWS\TDVIDEO.LOG,
    create a file called TDVIDEO.INI in the WINDOWS directory
    that contains the following commands:

      [VideoOptions]
      SaveWholeScreen=yes
      DebugFile=c:\windows\tdvideo.log

  Turbo Profiler and remote profiling of Windows applications
  ===========================================================

  Some system configurations may cause WREMOTE and TPROF to fail when
  profiling Windows applications on a remote system. The problem usually
  causes both your program and Windows to abort when you attempt to
  execute your program on the remote machine. If you experience this
  problem with your system configuration, there are several possible
  ways to avoid the problem.

    1. Use TPROFW to profile the program directly under Windows on one
       machine, rather than using two machines.

    2. Run Windows in standard mode (using the DOS command WIN /S), then load
       WREMOTE. On the local machine, use TPROF in passive analysis mode
       (note that passive analysis is not available in 386 enhanced mode.)

    3. If you require active analysis mode and cannot use TPROFW directly,
       the following procedure may provide a solution. First, load Windows
       and WREMOTE on the remote machine. Next, load TPROF on the local
       machine and, without running the program, remove all area markers
       using the Module window's local menu (Ctrl-R, A, from the Module
       window). With this, exit TPROF using Alt-X, thus creating a .TFA
       file having no areas marked.  Reload TPROF and your program; there
       should be no areas marked (you can verify this by opening an Areas
       window). Add any areas you are interested in examining, and begin
       profiling your program.



  CLASS LIBRARY

  - If you used the add(), addAt(), or getItemsInContainer()
    member functions of the Array class in Borland C++ 2.0
    applications, note that their behavior has changed slightly.
    The following rules apply to these and related functions:

      1. add() will insert its argument at the lowest available
         location in the Array.  This location is known as the
         "insertion point".

      2. detach() will remove its argument from the Array, and if
         that Object is located below the insertion point, it
         will move the elements above the Object being removed
         and below the insertion point down one position, so that
         the elements below the insertion point remain
         contiguous.  The insertion point, of course, moves down
         one.

      3. if the location specified in a call to addAt() is below
         or at the insertion point, the elements above the
         specified location and below the insertion point are
         moved up one position, and the Object is inserted.  The
         insertion point moves up one.

      4. if the location specified in a call to addAt() is above
         the insertion point, the Object is inserted at that
         location, replacing any Object that may have been placed
         there previously.

      5. getItemsInContainer() returns the number of elements
         below the current insertion point.  If you use addAt()
         to add elements above the insertion point, they will not
         affect the value returned by getItemsInContainer(). 
         This is a change from the behavior in the previous
         version of the class library.

  - Two versions of the class library sources are provided; one
    using an implementation using C++ templates, and one not using
    templates. The small and dynamic link libraries are provided, and
    a makefile is provided to build other models.

 5. TESTING YOUR EXPANDED MEMORY: EMSTEST.COM
---------------------------------------------

  Included with Borland C++ is a program to test your Expanded
  Memory hardware and software. If you have problems using
  Borland C++ with your EMS, type EMSTEST at the DOS prompt and
  follow the instructions.

Turbo Assembler User's Guide
----------------------------

Page 333 in Appendix D, Utilities, states that Turbo Assembler's
online help facility is called TASMHELP. TASMHELP can be used as
documented, but only if Turbo Assembler is installed in a
directory other than the directory where Borland C++ is
installed. If TASM is installed in the same directory as Borland
C++, use the THELP utility for online help. THELP allows you to
access a variety of help files via an easy to use menu system.

Here's how THELP works:

  1) After installing Borland C++ and Turbo Assembler, invoke THELP at
     your DOS prompt.

  2) Type ALT-F to bring up the menu of available help files.

  3) Choose TASM.TAH to access help for Turbo Assembler.

   IMPLIBW does allow you to create a single import library from
   multiple DLLs or module definition files. At the File Select
   dialog box, you can type multiple filenames in the File edit
   control. When you choose OK to make the import library,
   IMPLIBW will use all the exports from each of the DLLs or
   module definition files you listed. Note that you can only
   select a single file using the file list box; you must type in
   the filenames if you need to specify more than one.

   The last word of the page, "which" should be "while @<".

 Chapter 3, "TLIB: The Turbo librarian"
 --------------------------------------
 - There is an additional TLIB command line option, /0, which is
   not documented in the printed TLIB reference (Chapter 3 of the
   Tools & Utilities Guide).  The /0 option instructs the Turbo
   Librarian to remove all "Comment" records from the library. 
   Comment records are typically used to store information used
   by the debugger or other tools, and are not needed to create
   an executable file.  Using this option will make your
   libraries (and executable programs created using the
   libraries) smaller.  The /0 option is equivalent to checking
   Purge Comment Records in the Options|Librarian dialog box
   within the IDE.

  Reference:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Function: stackavail
  Gets the amount of available memory.

  Syntax:
  #include <malloc.h>
  size_t stackavail(void);

                     ^^^^^^^^
  Remarks:
  stackavail returns the number of bytes available on the stack. This
  is the amount of dynamic memory which alloca may access.

  Return value:
  stackavail returns a size_t value indicating the number of bytes
  available.

  See also:
  alloca, allocmem, coreleft, _dos_allocmem, farcoreleft,
  _stklen (global variable)

  Example:
  #include <malloc.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void) {
     char *buf;

     printf("\nThe stack: %u\tstack pointer: %u", stackavail(), _SP);
     buf = (char *) alloca(100 * sizeof(char));
     printf("\nNow, the stack: %u\tstack pointer: %u", stackavail(), _SP);
     return(0);
     }


  Program output:
    The stack: 63528         stack pointer: 65524
    Now, the stack: 63424    stack pointer: 65420


  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Function: strcmp, _fstrcmp
  Compares one string to another.

  Syntax:

  Remarks:
  strcmp performs an unsigned comparison of s1 to s2, starting with
  the  first character in each string and continuing with
  subsequent characters  until the corresponding characters differ
  or until the end of the strings is reached.

  Return value:
  strcmp returns a value that is

    < 0 if s1 is less than s2
    == 0 if s1 is the same as s2
    > 0 if s1 is greater than s2

  Remarks:
  Opens the file specified by filename, then prepares it for reading
  or writing. The file is always opened in binary mode.

  On successfully opening the file, the function sets the file pointer (which
  marks the current position in the file) to the beginning of the file.

  The maximum number of simultaneously open files is defined by HANDLE_MAX.

  Return Value:
  On success, _dos_open returns 0, stores the file handle at the location
    *handlep
  On error, _dos_open returns the DOS error code and sets errno to one
    of the following:
           ENOENT  (Path or file not found)
           EMFILE  (Too many open files)
           EACCES  (Permission denied)
           EINVACC (Invalid access code)
